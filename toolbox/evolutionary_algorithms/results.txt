To begin with, the evolutionary algorithm ran 500 generations and arrived at "THE ANSWER IS FORTY T", a distance of 2 from the goal text "THE ANSWER IS FORTY TWO". I changed the number of generations to 1000 and the distance was still 2; it took until about the 2900th generation to acheive the actual answer. By changing the probability of mutation to .5 from .2, however, the answer could easily be achieved within 500 generations (more around 280, actually).
